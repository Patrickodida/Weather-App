# Weather App 

A simple and modern weather application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall conditions. This project demonstrates practical skills in API integration, state management, and responsive UI design.

##  How It Works

###  API Integration

The app fetches weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) using a city name and displays the response dynamically. The API key is stored inside the component for demo purposes.

###  User Flow

1. App loads with default city (`Kampala`).
2. User enters a city name and clicks **Search city**.
3. App fetches data from the API and displays weather info.
4. If the city is invalid or not found, an error message is shown.
